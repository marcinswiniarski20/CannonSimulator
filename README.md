# CannonSimulator
Simulation of cannon ball programmed in Java using differential equations and Runge-Kutta method to solve this.
Intuitive GUI has been provided to this project. User can input various parameters(such as initial speed, mass of the ball, air resistance), which has an impact on flight of the ball.
Project has been realized for university subject "Methods of Mathematical Modeling", where main purpose was to get similiar with numerical integration.
